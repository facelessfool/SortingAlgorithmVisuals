# SortingAlgorithmVisuals

Just started today.
I have created only the skeleton code which works with the built in method sort().
I will keep updating by devoting two hours everyday here. 

Goal: 

  #Not following any guided tutorials. 
  #learn chart.js along the way
  

  Build a sorting algorithm visualiser with the following options:
    i) choice to use your own numbers or let the computer choose randomly
    ii) implement 
          a)_Selection Sort
          b)_Bubble Sort
          c)_Insertion Sort
          d)_Merge Sort
